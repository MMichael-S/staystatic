# Harp (+EJS) Static Site Sample

> Harp is a static web server that also serves Jade, Markdown, EJS, Less, Stylus, Sass, and CoffeeScript
> as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any configuration. It supports the beloved layout/partial
> paradigm and it has flexible metadata and global objects for traversing the file system and injecting
> custom data into templates. Optionally, Harp can also compile your project down to static assets for
> hosting behind any valid HTTP server.
